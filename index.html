			<h2>Our Values</h2>
				<p>UX Helping Hand recognizes where your heart is, and understands the struggle to increase what you have to work with. We recognize that your board members, donors, and volunteers are dedicated to a collective, public, or social benefit. </p>
				<p>We understand that you demonstrate and embody accountability, trustworthiness, honesty, and openness to every person who has invested time, money, and faith into your organization. We also understand that you are made up of volunteers who care and want to make a difference, that you need to do more with less, and that your charitable output  is your focus.</p>
				<p>We will help you make a greater impact. </p>

			<h2>What We Care About</h2>
				<p>When you are made up of volunteers and people who care, it can be tough to scale the big problems that lie before you. UX Helping Hand 's positive impact on those you serve – the people you're helping, your donors, your staff, and volunteers – is our focal point and what we care about. </p>
				<p>We want to make a difference, and we truly want to help, that's why we only work for nonprofits, organizations, and those who are truly helping others and the world. We are made up of real people too, so don't expect to get stock solutions and one-size-fits-all answers. We know your goal isn't to make money, and that you truly want to make a difference and improve lives. </p>
				<p>We will help you do that. </p>

			<h2>Consulting Services</h2>
				<p>The work that we perform is customized and unique to you, and will 100% work for your organization. That’s why UX Helping Hands will always be available to you, we will always ask questions, seek your guidance, and we will align our priorities to your charitable goals.</p>
				<p>The way in which we personally work with you enables us to examine and improve the perception, brand, identity, and validity of your organization. This working relationship will lead to increased donations, making it more likely for you to receive grants, and thereby allow you to achieve and surpass your charitable goals. We have helped other organizations in a variety of ways including increasing their visibility in the community through search engine optimization, helping automate and streamline their donation processes, and ultimately helping to promote to get more volunteers, donors, and grants.</p>
				<p>UX Helping Hand will enable you to know your user’s sentiments on your mission and how your funding is being spent. We will get you valuable data, reliable results, and surpass your charitable goals by understanding your user behavior and motivations. By empathizing with you users you can better leverage and serve your audiences, which will enable you to secure recurring funding, go after new funding sources, and expand your reach and impact. </p>
				<p>We will make that happen. </p>
